# Scraper Credit Usage (Lead Generation) Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of the "Scraper Credit Usage (Lead Generation)" flow with a robust credit hold mechanism that prevents double-spending and improves transaction management during lead generation searches.

## Implementation Components

### 1. Database Schema (supabase/migrations/003_credit_hold_mechanism.sql)

**New Table: credit_holds**
- Tracks temporary credit reservations
- Includes status, expiration, and reference information
- Links to credit ledger transactions

**Enhanced Functions:**
- `hold_credits()` - Create temporary credit holds
- `convert_hold_to_deduction()` - Convert holds to permanent deductions
- `release_credit_hold()` - Release holds without deduction
- `get_available_credit_balance()` - Calculate available credits (total - held)
- `cleanup_expired_holds()` - Maintenance function for expired holds

### 2. API Endpoints

**Credit Management Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/credits/scraper/hold` - Place credit holds
- `POST /api/credits/scraper/deduct` - Convert holds to deductions
- `POST /api/credits/scraper/release-hold` - Release holds
- `GET /api/credits/balance` - Enhanced balance with held credits
- `GET /api/credits/scraper/holds` - List user's credit holds

**Enhanced Scraper Endpoint:**
- `POST /api/scraper/search` - Updated to use credit hold mechanism

### 3. Service Layer Updates

**User Service Enhancements (src/lib/user-service.ts):**
- `holdCredits()` - Hold credits for specific operations
- `convertHoldToDeduction()` - Convert holds to deductions
- `releaseCreditHold()` - Release holds without deduction
- `getAvailableCreditBalance()` - Get available balance
- `getCreditHolds()` - List user's credit holds
- `getEnhancedCreditBalances()` - Get balances with held credits

### 4. Frontend Updates

**Enhanced Scraper Page (src/app/scraper/page.tsx):**
- Display total, held, and available credits
- Real-time status updates during search operations
- Better error messages with held credit information
- Credit usage transparency

## Flow Implementation

### 1. Credit Hold Flow

```mermaid

    participant Frontend
    participant ScraperAPI
    participant CreditAPI
    participant Database
    participant ExternalAPI

    Frontend->>ScraperAPI: POST /api/scraper/search
    ScraperAPI->>CreditAPI: GET /api/credits/balance
    CreditAPI->>Database: Query available credits
    Database-->>CreditAPI: Return available balance
    CreditAPI-->>ScraperAPI: Return credit info
    
    alt Insufficient Credits
        ScraperAPI-->>Frontend: Error: Insufficient credits
    else Sufficient Credits
        ScraperAPI->>CreditAPI: POST /api/credits/scraper/hold
        CreditAPI->>Database: Create credit hold
        Database-->>CreditAPI: Return hold_id
        CreditAPI-->>ScraperAPI: Return hold info
        
        ScraperAPI->>Database: Create lead_search record
        ScraperAPI->>ExternalAPI: Execute search
        
        alt Search Success
            ExternalAPI-->>ScraperAPI: Return leads data
            ScraperAPI->>Database: Save leads
            ScraperAPI->>CreditAPI: POST /api/credits/scraper/deduct
            CreditAPI->>Database: Convert hold to deduction
            Database-->>CreditAPI: Confirm deduction
            CreditAPI-->>ScraperAPI: Return transaction info
            ScraperAPI-->>Frontend: Return search results
        else Search Failure
            ExternalAPI-->>ScraperAPI: Return error
            ScraperAPI->>CreditAPI: POST /api/credits/scraper/release-hold
            CreditAPI->>Database: Release credit hold
            Database-->>CreditAPI: Confirm release
            CreditAPI-->>ScraperAPI: Return release info
            ScraperAPI-->>Frontend: Error: Search failed
        end
    end
```

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling

**Error Types:**
- `INSUFFICIENT_CREDITS` - User doesn't have enough available credits
- `HOLD_NOT_FOUND` - Credit hold not found or already processed
- `HOLD_EXPIRED` - Hold has expired
- `DEDUCTION_FAILED` - Failed to convert hold to deduction
- `RELEASE_FAILED` - Failed to release credit hold

**Error Response Format:**
```json
{
  "error": "Error message",
  "code": "ERROR_CODE",
  "details": {
    "available_credits": 30,
    "required_credits": 50,
    "held_credits": 20
  }
}
```

### 3. Transaction Safety

**Atomic Operations:**
- All credit operations use database transactions
- Proper rollback mechanisms on failures
- Race condition prevention

**Audit Trail:**
- Complete logging of all credit operations
- Link holds to transactions
- Maintain immutable audit records

## Key Features

### 1. Credit Hold Mechanism
- Prevents double-spending by reserving credits before operations
- Automatic expiration of holds (default: 1 hour)
- Support for partial refunds when actual usage differs from estimate

### 2. Enhanced Credit Balance
- Shows total, held, and available credits
- Real-time updates during operations
- Clear separation of different credit types

### 3. Improved User Experience

- Transparency in credit usage

### 4. Robust Error Handling
- Comprehensive error types and codes
- Detailed error responses
- Proper logging and monitoring

2. Keep new credit management endpoints for future use
3. Monitor system stability
4. Address issues before retrying deployment

### 3. Post-Rollback Activities
