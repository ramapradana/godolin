## Key Implementation Components

### 1. API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/credits/interaction/hold` | POST | Place temporary credit hold |
| `/api/credits/interaction/deduct` | POST | Convert hold to permanent deduction |
| `/api/credits/interaction/release-hold` | POST | Release hold without deduction |
| `/api/credits/interaction/balance` | GET | Get credit balance with holds |
| `/api/credits/interaction/holds` | GET | List user's credit holds |

### 2. Database Schema

The existing `credit_holds` table already supports interaction credits:
```sql
CREATE TABLE public.credit_holds (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES public.users(clerk_id),
  credit_type TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (credit_type IN ('scraper', 'interaction')),
  amount INTEGER NOT NULL,
  reference_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  status TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (status IN ('active', 'converted', 'released', 'expired')),
  expires_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### 3. WhatsApp Send Flow

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Sends Message] --> B[Check Available Credits]
    B --> C{Sufficient Credits?}
    C -->|No| D[Return Error]
    C -->|Yes| E[Place Credit Hold]
    E --> F[Create Message Record]
    F --> G[Send via WhatsApp API]
    G --> H{Success?}
    H -->|Yes| I[Convert Hold to Deduction]
    H -->|No| J[Release Hold]
    I --> K[Update Status to Sent]
    J --> L[Update Status to Failed]
```

### 4. Frontend Components

- **InteractionCreditDisplay**: Shows credit balance and held credits
- **MessageStatusIndicator**: Real-time message status updates
- **CreditHistory**: Transaction and hold history
- **CreditWarning**: Low credit alerts
