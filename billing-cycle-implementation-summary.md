# Monthly Billing Cycle Implementation Summary

This document provides a comprehensive summary of the Monthly Billing Cycle automated system process implementation plan, including all components, dependencies, and next steps.

## Project Overview

The Monthly Billing Cycle is a critical automated system that handles subscription renewals, payment processing, credit allocation, and customer notifications. It ensures reliable recurring revenue while providing a smooth experience for customers.

## System Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Billing Cron Job** - Internal scheduler that runs daily to check for due subscriptions
2. **Billing Service** - Core service that orchestrates the renewal process
3. **Payment Gateway Integration** - iPaymu integration for payment processing
4. **Credit Management Service** - Handles credit reset and accumulation
5. **Notification Service** - Manages email notifications with invoice PDFs
6. **Retry Management** - Handles payment retry logic with 5 attempts
